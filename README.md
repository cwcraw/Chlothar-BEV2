# Chlothar's Database
This project was started while I was at Code Chrysalis Coding Bootcamp in Tokyo. As a fan of table top role playing games I decided to create a fullstack app to create and save Pathfinder/D20 RPG characters. A year later I have revisited that project and decided to revamp it with what I have learnt as a developer. There will be a corresponding frontend app to take advantage of this DB and server.

## Technologies
This project uses ApolloServer and knex to create a GraphQl endpoint.

## Future Plans
1. Add more races
1. Add class support
1. Add inventory support
